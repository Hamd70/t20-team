 T20 World Cup 2022 Analysis – Picking the Best XI
 Overview

This project is all about diving into the T20 World Cup 2022 and using data to pick the best possible XI.
I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that looks at batting, bowling, and all-rounder stats. The idea was to let the numbers do the talking and see who really stood out in the tournament.

 What’s Inside

Player performance breakdowns – runs, strike rates, wickets, economy, and more
Team comparisons – who dominated and who struggled
Top performers – best batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders
A data-driven Best XI – not just opinions, but backed by stats
Interactive dashboard – filter, explore, and play with the data

 Tools I Used

Power BI – to build the dashboard
Excel/CSV data – stats from the T20 World Cup 2022
Power Query – for cleaning and shaping the data
